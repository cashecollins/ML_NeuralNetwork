Rules:

1.	Don't push without an approved pull request
2.	By Tadayon's request, we need one branch per official version, which I 
		translate as each time we change our model by adding layers or 
		changing the number of nodes. 
3.	Don't change the version branch directly. There is a master branch, but
		we won't be using it. We will decide to open a new version, which
		will directly branch off the last version branch. Each team
		member should have their own branch that feeds into each version
		branch. Message me if you're confused or have questions.
